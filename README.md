## "Preventing the spread of natural fires in the Sverdlovsk region with the help of remote sensing data".
 
 

We created this project in Tavatuy. 



### Problem:
The measures taken to prevent natural fires in the Sverdlovsk region are not enough, and this may negatively affect the situation in the near future.


### Our Goal: 
To identify new methods to prevent natural fires through the use of GIS and remote sensing.


### Objectives: 
- To determine the causes of fires.
- To identify the impact of fires on the environment.
- To study methods of fire prevention.
- Analyze space images using the QGIS geoinformation system.
- Develop new methods to prevent the spread of fires.
- Create an application for Android OS to display natural fires in the Sverdlovsk region with the ability to mark the observed fires.
