## "Preventing the spread of natural fires in the Sverdlovsk region with the help of remote sensing data".
 
 

We created this project in Tavatuy. 



### Problem:
Ambient noise affects people's health and well-being. Damage to the nervous system, high blood pressure, fatigue, reduced attention span, and hearing loss are all consequences of noise pollution.


### Our Goal: 
To identify new methods to prevent natural fires through the use of GIS and remote sensing.


### Objectives: 
- Reading the user's geolocation
- To identify the impact of fires on the environment.
- To study methods of fire prevention.
- Analyze space images using the QGIS geoinformation system.
- Develop new methods to prevent the spread of fires.
- Create an application for Android OS to display natural fires in the Sverdlovsk region with the ability to mark the observed fires.
